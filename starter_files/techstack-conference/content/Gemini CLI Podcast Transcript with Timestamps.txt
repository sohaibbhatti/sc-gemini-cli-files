00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
This week, on The Agent Factory, it's the agentic looping action.

00:05.800 --> 00:08.000
I'm not very good at like sitting down and reading.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.800
My read later folder has its own gravitational pull.

00:11.800 --> 00:16.000
With AI, using AI these days, it is so easy to 10x to yourself.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.800
100x, that's the hard part.

00:18.800 --> 00:22.000
Yeah, and my mom watches these, so mom, I'm still alive.

00:22.000 --> 00:35.000
Hi, everyone, and welcome to The Agent Factory, the podcast that goes beyond the hype and dives into building production-ready AI agents.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
I'm Molly Bennett.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
And I'm Emma Morage.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
And today we're going to be diving deep into the Gemini CLI.

00:42.000 --> 00:49.000
So we used the CLI a bit in our last episode, including this live vibe coding demo that was a ton of fun.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
I suggest you check it out if you haven't seen it yet.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm really excited to show it off in more detail.

00:54.000 --> 01:04.000
And for anyone who hasn't heard or used a haven't hasn't heard of or used the Gemini CLI yet, it's a really powerful agent lives right in your command line.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
And it's designed to help you with your everyday workflows.

01:08.000 --> 01:17.000
Yeah, and I'm really excited because in this episode, we're actually going to show you how to use Gemini CLI for getting up to speed on a new code base, super charging your research.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
And how you can use it to integrate it into your own automations.

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah, and to help us do that, we're very excited to have Taylor Mullin, the creator of Gemini CLI with us today.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
We're going to pick his brain about the philosophy behind the tool and what's next on the roadmap, which I'm very excited to hear about.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Yeah, I can't wait.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
I mean, I've been using the CLI now for a few weeks and I already feel like it's become a mainstay in my workflow.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
What about you, Molly? What's your take?

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Oh, yeah, no, I'm totally sold.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
For me, the biggest thing is that it lives in the terminal where I do my work.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
I was also able to add it directly to VS code, the IDE I use. So that was super handy.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
Yeah, I feel like having it integrated into so many different tools makes it indispensable.

02:03.000 --> 02:14.000
And also on that note, having Taylor with us here today, who's going to be able to tell us even more about the background and philosophy behind Gemini CLI will be invaluable.

02:14.000 --> 02:23.000
But before we talk to Taylor, let's get hands on with some demos on the facts before.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
Let's tackle a universal developer problem, which is onboarding onto a new code base.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
I think all of us have had to do this at some point.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
I'm going to go ahead and show how the Gemini CLI can help speed up this onboarding process.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
Okay, yeah, so code base exploration, that sounds pretty cool.

02:41.000 --> 02:48.000
And I feel like this will also be a really good showcase for Gemini CLI's massive 1 million token context window.

02:48.000 --> 02:56.000
I feel like that's kind of the difference between asking questions about a single file versus maybe the entire architecture all at one.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah, yeah, totally.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
And so to start, I'm actually not even going to clone the repo myself.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
I'm just going to ask the agent to do it for me.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
So I've decided to use Google's ADK repo for this example.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
So ADK stands for agent development kit.

03:13.000 --> 03:21.000
So I'm just going to say clone the Google ADK Python repo from GitHub.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
And I'm going to see what it does.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
Okay, so it's searching the web trying to find the right link.

03:32.000 --> 03:41.000
I found the right link. It's asking me for permission to clone it. Go ahead.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Cool. Yeah, and this looks like it's the agent group in action.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
It's kind of reasoning that it needs a piece of information.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
It then chooses a tool to get that information looks like.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
And then it uses that information to complete the original request.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
And then also at the same time, it asks you if you want to proceed.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
Backing back in. So yeah, this is a super helpful workflow.

04:03.000 --> 04:12.000
I think the way I want to tackle this is let's imagine that we're like a new contributor to this project.

04:12.000 --> 04:19.000
What do you think is the first like what's the first thing you'd want to do if you were a new contributor to a project and you wanted to figure out how to go forward.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Feel like I would want to get a high level understanding of the project.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
I think I learned best maybe from like a top down perspective.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Things like tech stack, how code of structure and stuff like that.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah, yeah, totally like in the past.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
And then not so distant past actually.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
You know, you might start with like reading a read me file, maybe contributing file.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
You know, start piecing things together that way.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
And like, I'm not very good at like sitting down and reading a huge amount of documentation to be quite honest.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
So instead, I'm going to ask the Gemini CLI to perform a high level audit of the entire directory.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
So let's see.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
I'm going to ask the Gemini CLI agent for a complete project overview.

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
I want it to tell me the purpose, the tech stack and analyze architecture all in one go.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
Yeah, and I feel like that's much more powerful than just relying on one read me document.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Like this way, you can kind of point at the whole directory.

05:22.000 --> 05:32.000
And it's cool because you're asking it to like synthesize everything, the source, build file, the docs, all of the code into a single coherent sort of overview, right?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

05:34.000 --> 05:41.000
Yeah, it's like it's ingesting the entire directory to build out this like complete mental model of the project, which is super helpful.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Okay, great.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Starting to output.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
This looks really good and helpful.

05:52.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah, it identified the purpose, the tech stack, core dependencies, all that good stuff that's like helpful to kind of know what the outlet.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah, it's really verbose what it did.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
Summary, I wouldn't have been able to write it better myself, right?

06:08.000 --> 06:17.000
Yeah, and now for the part of the show that we've both been waiting for, we're going to shift gears and get a deep dive into the philosophy and future of Gemini CLI.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
We'd now like to welcome to the podcast Taylor Mullin, creator of Gemini CLI.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Taylor, thank you so much for joining us.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Thanks for having me.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
It's fun to be here.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Yeah, so let's start at the very beginning.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Could you tell us the origin story of the Gemini CLI?

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
What was the initial spark or inspiration that led to it and how did things go from there?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
I'm very curious to hear.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Oh, yeah, it's kind of crazy.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
It started about a year and a half ago, weirdly enough, right?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
It's so long ago.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Wow.

06:47.000 --> 06:54.000
But like at the time, I was experimenting with multi agent systems and trying to get like the most out of our elements.

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
And so at the time, like I had the system where the multiple personas, they were talking to each other and they were doing a lot of cool things.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
And it was surfaced in a lot of different ways.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
It was surfaced in IDE, it was surfaced in a CLI.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
It was surfaced in the web.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
And as I was playing with these things, the thing that really stuck for me was the CLI.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
It was so easy to use, it was a lightweight.

07:17.000 --> 07:27.000
But at the time, like it took 30 requests, like one user request resulted in like 30 LLM requests behind the scenes.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
And those 30 requests was a lot for us a lot for the time.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
It took a minute and a half to respond to anything.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
And while the quality was there, like this was something at the time that was just too much.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Like we also have limited context window.

07:41.000 --> 07:50.000
And so in that realm, it being a CLI and it having all these constraints, we scrapped the project.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
And that was kind of challenging at the time.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
It was almost a little bit too early.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Yeah.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
It was like, is this one of those things like, okay, no one's going to want to use this because it cost too much.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
It couldn't absorb enough information and it took too long to respond.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Which is kind of a trippy thing like fast forwarding today, right?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
We're very much used to, you have deep research.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
Like you click a button and then you go off and you get a coffee and you come back and hopefully it's done.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
And it's crazy.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
It's so different.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
But during that time, like it was too early.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
And then today, like me, Google and me, I'm really trying to like build this future of developer tools.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
Like there was this ecosystem of CLIs that was just taking hold in the community, right?

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
And it really proved that people are willing to wait.

08:38.000 --> 08:45.000
People are willing to use a CLI and they find it, they found it as compelling as they I did back then.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
It's like, when all this started to happen, I'm like, oh my goodness.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
Maybe I was just too early and maybe we should try and give this another go.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
And so that like I really grounded at least the motivation of saying, okay, I've done this before.

08:58.000 --> 09:05.000
And like I've learned a lot over my entire career of what it means to build developer tools and what it means.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
It's like build something that can kind of span a lot of ecosystems.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
And so we started Gemini CLI from that point.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
So it's like, I basically, I went dark. I honestly, I went dark for like a week.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
And I'm like, okay, I'm going to do this.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
I have this idea that when dark for a week, talked to no one, spent every waking second,

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
was getting like five to six hours of sleep in the night.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
And this was like, I think it was like Saturday through Saturday,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Saturday through Sunday or something like that.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
And then like that Monday, I had a prototype.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Oh wow.

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
Did a video, I put it out and Googlers started just going like wild for it.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
It was super cool.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Yeah, thanks so much for sharing that.

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
And so I guess building on that, you know, making the Gemini CLI open source was a very deliberate choice, I think,

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
which you've linked to security and learning and a whole host of other things.

09:55.000 --> 10:04.000
So how does this open, trust-based approach contrast with the more like black box nature of other maybe major AI tools out there?

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
And what kind of ecosystem do you hope that this will foster the transparency will foster?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Yeah, it's like to be frigate.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
I started my career in open source.

10:15.000 --> 10:21.000
Like I have always been in developer tooling or framework to one thing and the other and open source has been like front and center.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
So like from day zero, that was a key thing in my head.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
But most folks feel like, oh, it's open source.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Why would you not go ahead and do it?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Open source is not free.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
It's not free.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
It's actually a very challenging thing to get right.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
But oh my gosh, it's so rewarding when you do.

10:39.000 --> 10:45.000
So like knowing this, it was always this question like, okay, let's weigh the actual balance.

10:45.000 --> 10:52.000
Like should it be open source should not be in the answers ended being like obviously it should be open source, like especially with a CLI tool like this.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
That's forward like for a wide variety of people and of course developers as well.

10:57.000 --> 11:03.000
But something that people could see and could understand, okay, it's running on my box.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
It has a lot of capability.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
So what does it do and can I trust it?

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
It's like that kind of like you mentioned the security aspect.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
That was one of our biggest reasons for like open sourcing this.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
We want people to see exactly how it operates.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
So they can have they can have trust.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
They know we're not doing anything behind the scenes.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
They know exactly what's happening.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
And also means that if we make a mistake.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
That we can fix it that we have the entire community to help keep us grounded.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
And what makes the most secure sense we to be frank, we struggle to keep up.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
We totally struggle to keep up with all the energy they give.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
But to be frank, it's one of the most important things that we have.

11:45.000 --> 11:53.000
And so when people ask me like, what is the number one thing that's on your mind for Jim and I see a line like it's our open source community.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Like by far, it's number one.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
And that's like, I think we've shut down the team.

11:58.000 --> 12:06.000
Like literally everyone on the team for like days in order to make sure that we can try and keep up with the amount of traction and the amount of energy coming at us.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
But I think that's because we see the value.

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
We see how valuable it is to kind of build this in the open together.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
So that folks have that confidence that we're doing the right thing.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
And we have that confidence we're building the right things as well.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
And it's funny.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
We actually still do the updates today.

12:24.000 --> 12:35.000
Actually on all of our socials will post every single week on Wednesdays will post like 100 to 150 features weekly features bugs enhancements all the above.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
You said 150 features a week, right?

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
That's a lot.

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
What are the mechanisms that you use you and the team used to make that possible?

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
Because we use it to build itself like it allows us to.

12:50.000 --> 12:58.000
Allow us to do a lot more like one of the coolest things I think that we started doing is when you teach it to boot itself.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
It means it can spin up parallel like threads simultaneously.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
And each of those can go ahead and tackle different problems.

13:06.000 --> 13:14.000
Combine that with work get work trees and you're going even further so far gone are the days of being able to ship like twice a year.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Which is a huge part of software historically.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
Because in AI every single week is like an insane amount of time.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
Every single month is like yeah.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Absolutely.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
So I think it's it's honestly it's just that it's a mindset such cultural thing that we've built.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
And I also want to kind of acknowledge our open source community again as well.

13:36.000 --> 13:43.000
Which is they really help make it possible because without folks really contributing helping each other out even.

13:43.000 --> 13:53.000
I don't know how easy it would it would be like we put human eyes on every single one of the changes that go and we don't we're not just like letting things go without looking at them.

13:53.000 --> 14:03.000
It's just we have a lot of really passionate really smart capable and motivated people to kind of make the right decisions at scale.

14:03.000 --> 14:12.000
You use Gemini CLI to build Gemini CLI so I'm curious to tell a little bit more about how that journey started and and kind of what was your favorite part of it.

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
Yeah, it's kind of nuts like I still remember actually the first feature it built for itself.

14:18.000 --> 14:25.000
Which is it's kind of crazy it was I see it's so long but it really wasn't that long ago.

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
But early on we knew that markdown rendering was going to be important right.

14:31.000 --> 14:38.000
So I'm sitting there and I'm trying to build out it's ability to render mark down a set it is seeing the raw markdown is in the terminal.

14:38.000 --> 14:51.000
And there was a lot of utilities and frameworks to make this possible and I kept I forget the exact of the wall that I was hitting but I kept hitting a wall and using one of these frameworks that was like just a limiter and this was a hard stop for me.

14:51.000 --> 15:05.000
And okay like I need to progress I need to do something and I ended up asking hey like what are my options as the first I'm just asking is that when I was asking it more questions to tell learn more.

15:05.000 --> 15:12.000
And it's like oh I can write a markdown parser for you said cool go for it.

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
So this is the first time when it one shot it's own marked on rendering.

15:18.000 --> 15:29.000
And to be frank a variant of that is still used today that actually renders. So if you're ever curious like if like Gemini CLI has written a significant amount of its own code.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
It's super significant amount so cool.

15:33.000 --> 16:00.000
We doubt like I think the biggest thing that we think about on the team is with AI using AI these days it is so easy to 10X yourself which sounds crazy to say but 10Xing is easy these days 100Xing that's the hard part like that is where you really start getting into how can I paralyze my workflows to make sure my time that I'm investing in each of these things is best spit.

16:00.000 --> 16:17.000
Because models themselves that we talked about it there like there's so much that's left unsaid when asking a question they it still needs human feedback a lot of the times in order to be effective like things don't just get one shot of the right of course you see that in all the videos out there and like all the highlights.

16:17.000 --> 16:28.000
But one shoting rarely happens so how do you optimize your time to make it so that multi shot scenarios are the land super well they can really amplify what you do.

16:28.000 --> 16:43.000
Another thing I'm curious about is are there any like methodologies you think about when using Gemini CLI like what's your mentality on how the tool operates is grounded in a lot of my developer background especially with AI.

16:43.000 --> 17:00.000
Which is I personally feel like there's so much that's left unsaid when people will do a prop so like one of the big things is this is context engineering it's kind of grounded in the same mindset which is when you ask a question to your to your AI of choice.

17:01.000 --> 17:26.000
You're giving it as much information as you possibly can to enable it to derive the right answer now of course you're also leaning on its ability to like figure out more information and dig through your co base or whatever you're by doing at the time but that alone is really challenging spot because it can't know those offline conversations you have with your colleague or your friend it can't know.

17:27.000 --> 17:38.000
Usually doesn't know your emails and your chat messages but it doesn't typically know that all those pieces of context really feed into building a coherent response.

17:38.000 --> 17:45.000
So if you're currently writing tests and you ask to go ahead and implement something chances are you want to implement that in the form of tests.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
Your current workflow that methodology though it kind of rings true with every decision we make.

17:52.000 --> 18:13.000
I think the thing I tell the team is that do what a person would do and don't take shortcuts so one thing I might be surprising to folks is we don't use embeddings like for instance for search we do not index your code base we do a genetic search which means how you as a person or use as a developer would dig through a piece of code.

18:14.000 --> 18:39.000
We do the same thing we'll do fine we'll do we'll we'll grab our way through the co base will open files or read them will effectively run commands like find all references on your behalf if we need to to find out what's the next piece of the puzzle because in the end we're trying to provide the right context to the LM so that it's grounded in every single thing it does to come to a good a good result.

18:39.000 --> 18:44.000
So I think you think it's probably it was probably the biggest one. I think that kind of really resonates with us.

18:44.000 --> 18:53.000
Something that I think is really cool is like maybe I'll ask the CLI to do something and it'll try to do the thing but be like well I can't actually do this.

18:54.000 --> 19:05.000
But then you'll give me the steps that it needs to take in order to do it and be like are you okay with me going ahead and doing these steps to do the thing that I need to do to get to your original request which is very cool.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
I love that's the that's such a huge unlock is the we call it self healing.

19:11.000 --> 19:21.000
Yeah, it's ability to self heal goes so far and like when it will try things like it has a good idea of what's on your box and to try to use all those things that when it can't do it.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
It's so good at coming up with other alternatives like I recall this one scenario.

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
I was talking to our marketing folks and I was giving them a demo to show what it could do.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
And then the first question was oh, can I like can you give me a link to this.

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
And I'm like oh, it's we don't we don't have built in like deploy functionality like there's a cloud run.

19:41.000 --> 19:47.000
There's a cloud run extension actually being released very soon that will enable this just so folks know.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
But we don't have that built it.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
And so they're asking how can you do this? Okay, well let me just ask.

19:54.000 --> 20:02.000
And what it did is it ended up like creating a GitHub repository and give repositories have a thing called GitHub pages, which allows you to host static content.

20:02.000 --> 20:09.000
And then it pushed this content to it and it gave me a link and I gave it I'm like I had never even considered that.

20:09.000 --> 20:16.000
And my question was how do I give this person like hit it but all the other pieces together to kind of make that a reality.

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
Like the scrap scrapiest developer. Yeah, I'm almost thinking of the use case where I'm like hey Gemini CLI.

20:22.000 --> 20:28.000
How can I like tell my mom that I'm still alive like update her and it'll like ask me maybe you should do that.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
But here are the steps that I would take like are you okay?

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
I think about the text messages and whatever.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Totally.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
Yeah and my mom watches these so mom I'm still alive.

20:39.000 --> 20:49.000
Well, and also a moment ago you mentioned something about like an upcoming feature on the roadmap.

20:49.000 --> 20:56.000
So what else like what else is coming up on the roadmap like are there any features coming up that you're most excited for.

20:56.000 --> 21:06.000
Because we've viewed Gemini CLI as being a lot more than just developers and because we've seen internally it's unlocking every profession whether you're a marketer, financial to of course the software developer.

21:06.000 --> 21:13.000
It kind of tax like hits all those those buttons to make it so we can work with every one of these professions.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
We're really doubling down on extensibility.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
So you can heavily extend Gemini CLI and this is not just MCP servers.

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
This is like literally you can install an extension which is a bundle of it could be MCP servers.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
Specific instructions, specific commands, lots of different things to drive a difference.

21:32.000 --> 21:40.000
So this is the cloud run one that I had mentioned earlier they have an extension and this extension can be Gemini extensions install.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
And then even passing cloud run and it's seamless installation.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
But enables you to really curate the experience to your like your preferences.

21:49.000 --> 21:58.000
So for instance if you are like a go developer and you want to make sure your environment is super go friendly like you'll install the right MCP servers to make that happen.

21:58.000 --> 22:03.000
Or if you are it's a content generator maybe you'll hook it up to all your various socials.

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
Maybe you'll create a generative media APIs and you'll also hook that up to it.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
So being able to turn these on in office when it's super important to us because we know that there's a lot of use cases.

22:13.000 --> 22:23.000
And so the big so that's the biggest feature that we're going to be talking about soon, which is how to build these extensions, how to install them, manage them.

22:23.000 --> 22:34.000
With the intention of making this super seamless for people where people can spin up their own registries for they want to we're going to have eventually going to have like a centralized registry for all of our extensions.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
But the extension ecosystem is going to be the big one.

22:37.000 --> 22:45.000
I can't wait to see what people build like we have a number of them coming out from Google from cloud.

22:45.000 --> 22:51.000
And just in general to really hook Gemini CLI into everything in a really seamless way.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
Taylor, I just wanted to thank you so much for sharing your insights with us and our audience of agent builders.
