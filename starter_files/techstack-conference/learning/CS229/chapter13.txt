2. Thus, our choice of a basis preserves as much variability
as possible in the original data.
PCA can also be derived by picking the basis that minimizes the ap-
proximation error arising from projecting the data onto the k-dimensional
subspace spanned by them. (See more in homework.)
PCA has many applications; we will close our discussion with a few exam-
ples. First, compression—representing x(i)’s with lower dimension y(i)’s—is
an obvious application. If we reduce high dimensional data to k = 2 or 3 di-
mensions, then we can also plot the y(i)’s to visualize the data. For instance,
if we were to reduce our automobiles data to 2 dimensions, then we can plot
it (one point in our plot would correspond to one car type, say) to see what
cars are similar to each other and what groups of cars may cluster together.
Another standard application is to preprocess a dataset to reduce its
dimension before running a supervised learning learning algorithm with the
x(i)’s as inputs. Apart from computational beneﬁts, reducing the data’s
dimension can also reduce the complexity of the hypothesis class considered
and help avoid overﬁtting (e.g., linear classiﬁers over lower dimensional input
spaces will have smaller VC dimension).
Lastly, as in our RC pilot example, we can also view PCA as a noise
reduction algorithm. In our example it, estimates the intrinsic “piloting
karma” from the noisy measures of piloting skill and enjoyment. In class, we
also saw the application of this idea to face images, resulting in eigenfaces
method. Here, each point x(i) ∈ R100×100 was a 10000 dimensional vector,
with each coordinate corresponding to a pixel intensity value in a 100x100
image of a face. Using PCA, we represent each image x(i) with a much lower-
dimensional y(i). In doing so, we hope that the principal components we
found retain the interesting, systematic variations between faces that capture
what a person really looks like, but not the “noise” in the images introduced
by minor lighting variations, slightly diﬀerent imaging conditions, and so on.
We then measure distances between faces i and j by working in the reduced
dimension, and computing ∥y(i) − y(j)∥2. This resulted in a surprisingly good
face-matching and retrieval algorithm.

Independent components
analysis
Our next topic is Independent Components Analysis (ICA). Similar to PCA,
this will ﬁnd a new basis in which to represent our data. However, the goal
is very diﬀerent.
As a motivating example, consider the “cocktail party problem.” Here, d
speakers are speaking simultaneously at a party, and any microphone placed
in the room records only an overlapping combination of thed speakers’ voices.
But lets say we haved diﬀerent microphones placed in the room, and because
each microphone is a diﬀerent distance from each of the speakers, it records a
diﬀerent combination of the speakers’ voices. Using these microphone record-
ings, can we separate out the original d speakers’ speech signals?
To formalize this problem, we imagine that there is some data s ∈ Rd
that is generated via d independent sources. What we observe is
x = As,
where A is an unknown square matrix called the mixing matrix. Repeated
observations gives us a dataset {x(i); i = 1, . . . , n}, and our goal is to recover
the sources s(i) that had generated our data ( x(i) = As(i)).
In our cocktail party problem, s(i) is an d-dimensional vector, and s(i)
j is
the sound that speaker j was uttering at time i. Also, x(i) in an d-dimensional
vector, and x(i)
j is the acoustic reading recorded by microphone j at time i.
Let W = A−1 be the unmixing matrix. Our goal is to ﬁnd W , so
that given our microphone recordings x(i), we can recover the sources by
computing s(i) = W x(i). For notational convenience, we also let wT
i denote
171

172
the i-th row of W , so that
W =


— wT
1 —
...
— wT
d —

 .
Thus, wi ∈ Rd, and the j-th source can be recovered as s(i)
j = wT
j x(i).
13.1 ICA ambiguities
To what degree can W = A−1 be recovered? If we have no prior knowledge
about the sources and the mixing matrix, it is easy to see that there are some
inherent ambiguities in A that are impossible to recover, given only the x(i)’s.
Speciﬁcally, let P be any d-by-d permutation matrix. This means that
each row and each column of P has exactly one “1.” Here are some examples
of permutation matrices:
P =


0 1 0
1 0 0
0 0 1

 ; P =
[ 0 1
1 0
]
; P =
[ 1 0
0 1
]
.
If z is a vector, then P z is another vector that contains a permuted version
of z’s coordinates. Given only the x(i)’s, there will be no way to distinguish
between W and P W. Speciﬁcally, the permutation of the original sources is
ambiguous, which should be no surprise. Fortunately, this does not matter
for most applications.
Further, there is no way to recover the correct scaling of the wi’s. For in-
stance, if A were replaced with 2A, and every s(i) were replaced with (0.5)s(i),
then our observed x(i) = 2A · (0.5)s(i) would still be the same. More broadly,
if a single column of A were scaled by a factor of α, and the corresponding
source were scaled by a factor of 1/α, then there is again no way to determine
that this had happened given only the x(i)’s. Thus, we cannot recover the
“correct” scaling of the sources. However, for the applications that we are
concerned with—including the cocktail party problem—this ambiguity also
does not matter. Speciﬁcally, scaling a speaker’s speech signal s(i)
j by some
positive factor α aﬀects only the volume of that speaker’s speech. Also, sign
changes do not matter, and s(i)
j and −s(i)
j sound identical when played on a
speaker. Thus, if the wi found by an algorithm is scaled by any non-zero real
number, the corresponding recovered source si = wT
i x will be scaled by the

173
same factor; but this usually does not matter. (These comments also apply
to ICA for the brain/MEG data that we talked about in class.)
Are these the only sources of ambiguity in ICA? It turns out that they
are, so long as the sources si are non-Gaussian. To see what the diﬃculty is
with Gaussian data, consider an example in which n = 2, and s ∼ N (0, I).
Here, I is the 2x2 identity matrix. Note that the contours of the density of
the standard normal distribution N (0, I) are circles centered on the origin,
and the density is rotationally symmetric.
Now, suppose we observe some x = As, where A is our mixing matrix.
Then, the distribution of x will be Gaussian, x ∼ N (0, AAT ), since
Es∼N (0,I)[x] = E[As] = AE[s] = 0
Cov[x] = Es∼N (0,I)[xxT ] = E[AssT AT ] = AE[ssT ]AT = A · Cov[s] · AT = AAT
Now, let R be an arbitrary orthogonal (less formally, a rotation/reﬂection)
matrix, so that RRT = RT R = I, and let A′ = AR. Then if the data had
been mixed according to A′ instead of A, we would have instead observed
x′ = A′s. The distribution of x′ is also Gaussian, x′ ∼ N (0, AAT ), since
Es∼N (0,I)[x′(x′)T ] = E[ A′ssT (A′)T ] = E[ ARssT (AR)T ] = ARRT AT = AAT .
Hence, whether the mixing matrix is A or A′, we would observe data from
a N (0, AAT ) distribution. Thus, there is no way to tell if the sources were
mixed using A and A′. There is an arbitrary rotational component in the
mixing matrix that cannot be determined from the data, and we cannot
recover the original sources.
Our argument above was based on the fact that the multivariate standard
normal distribution is rotationally symmetric. Despite the bleak picture that
this paints for ICA on Gaussian data, it turns out that, so long as the data is
not Gaussian, it is possible, given enough data, to recover the d independent
sources.
13.2 Densities and linear transformations
Before moving on to derive the ICA algorithm proper, we ﬁrst digress brieﬂy
to talk about the eﬀect of linear transformations on densities.
Suppose a random variable s is drawn according to some density ps(s).
For simplicity, assume for now that s ∈ R is a real number. Now, let the
random variable x be deﬁned according to x = As (here, x ∈ R, A ∈ R). Let
px be the density of x. What is px?
Let W = A−1. To calculate the “probability” of a particular value of x,
it is tempting to compute s = W x, then then evaluate ps at that point, and

174
conclude that “ px(x) = ps(W x).” However, this is incorrect . For example,
let s ∼ Uniform[0, 1], so ps(s) = 1 {0 ≤ s ≤ 1}. Now, let A = 2, so x = 2s.
Clearly, x is distributed uniformly in the interval [0 , 2]. Thus, its density is
given by px(x) = (0 .5)1{0 ≤ x ≤ 2}. This does not equal ps(W x), where
W = 0.5 = A−1. Instead, the correct formula is px(x) = ps(W x)|W |.
More generally, if s is a vector-valued distribution with density ps, and
x = As for a square, invertible matrix A, then the density of x is given by
px(x) = ps(W x) · |W |,
where W = A−1.
Remark. If you’re seen the result that A maps [0, 1]d to a set of volume |A|,
then here’s another way to remember the formula forpx given above, that also
generalizes our previous 1-dimensional example. Speciﬁcally, let A ∈ Rd×d be
given, and let W = A−1 as usual. Also let C1 = [0, 1]d be the d-dimensional
hypercube, and deﬁne C2 = {As : s ∈ C1} ⊆ Rd to be the image of C1
under the mapping given by A. Then it is a standard result in linear algebra
(and, indeed, one of the ways of deﬁning determinants) that the volume of
C2 is given by |A|. Now, suppose s is uniformly distributed in [0 , 1]d, so its
density is ps(s) = 1 {s ∈ C1}. Then clearly x will be uniformly distributed
in C2. Its density is therefore found to be px(x) = 1{x ∈ C2}/vol(C2) (since
it must integrate over C2 to 1). But using the fact that the determinant
of the inverse of a matrix is just the inverse of the determinant, we have
1/vol(C2) = 1/|A| = |A−1| = |W |. Thus, px(x) = 1{x ∈ C2}|W | = 1{W x ∈
C1}|W | = ps(W x)|W |.
13.3 ICA algorithm
We are now ready to derive an ICA algorithm. We describe an algorithm
by Bell and Sejnowski, and we give an interpretation of their algorithm as a
method for maximum likelihood estimation. (This is diﬀerent from their orig-
inal interpretation involving a complicated idea called the infomax principal
which is no longer necessary given the modern understanding of ICA.)
We suppose that the distribution of each source sj is given by a density
ps, and that the joint distribution of the sources s is given by
p(s) =
d∏
j=1
ps(sj).

175
Note that by modeling the joint distribution as a product of marginals, we
capture the assumption that the sources are independent. Using our formulas
from the previous section, this implies the following density on x = As =
W−1s:
p(x) =
d∏
j=1
ps(wT
j x) · |W |.
All that remains is to specify a density for the individual sources ps.
Recall that, given a real-valued random variable z, its cumulative distri-
bution function (cdf) F is deﬁned by F (z0) = P (z ≤ z0) =
∫ z0
−∞ pz(z)dz and
the density is the derivative of the cdf: pz(z) = F′(z).
Thus, to specify a density for the si’s, all we need to do is to specify some
cdf for it. A cdf has to be a monotonic function that increases from zero
to one. Following our previous discussion, we cannot choose the Gaussian
cdf, as ICA doesn’t work on Gaussian data. What we’ll choose instead as
a reasonable “default” cdf that slowly increases from 0 to 1, is the sigmoid
function g(s) = 1/(1 + e−s). Hence, ps(s) = g′(s).1
The square matrix W is the parameter in our model. Given a training
set {x(i); i = 1, . . . , n}, the log likelihood is given by
ℓ(W ) =
n∑
i=1
( d∑
j=1
log g′(wT
j x(i)) + log|W |
)
.
We would like to maximize this in terms W . By taking derivatives and using
the fact (from the ﬁrst set of notes) that ∇W |W | = |W |(W−1)T , we easily
derive a stochastic gradient ascent learning rule. For a training example x(i),
the update rule is:
W := W + α




1 − 2g(wT
1 x(i))
1 − 2g(wT
2 x(i))
...
1 − 2g(wT
d x(i))

 x(i)T + (W T )−1

 ,
1If you have prior knowledge that the sources’ densities take a certain form, then it
is a good idea to substitute that in here. But in the absence of such knowledge, the
sigmoid function can be thought of as a reasonable default that seems to work well for
many problems. Also, the presentation here assumes that either the data x(i) has been
preprocessed to have zero mean, or that it can naturally be expected to have zero mean
(such as acoustic signals). This is necessary because our assumption that ps(s) = g′(s)
implies E[s] = 0 (the derivative of the logistic function is a symmetric function, and
hence gives a density corresponding to a random variable with zero mean), which implies
E[x] = E[As] = 0.
