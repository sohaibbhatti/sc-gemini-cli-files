The parameters for our new model are φy = p(y) as before, φk|y=1 =
p(xj = k|y = 1) (for any j) and φk|y=0 = p(xj = k|y = 0). Note that we have
assumed that p(xj|y) is the same for all values of j (i.e., that the distribution
according to which a word is generated does not depend on its position j
within the email).
If we are given a training set {(x(i), y(i)); i = 1 , . . . , n} where x(i) =
(x(i)
1 , x(i)
2 , . . . , x(i)
di ) (here, di is the number of words in thei-training example),
the likelihood of the data is given by
L(φy, φk|y=0, φk|y=1) =
n∏
i=1
p(x(i), y(i))
=
n∏
i=1
( di∏
j=1
p(x(i)
j |y; φk|y=0, φk|y=1)
)
p(y(i); φy).
Maximizing this yields the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters:
φk|y=1 =
∑n
i=1
∑di
j=1 1{x(i)
j = k ∧ y(i) = 1}∑n
i=1 1{y(i) = 1}di
φk|y=0 =
∑n
i=1
∑di
j=1 1{x(i)
j = k ∧ y(i) = 0}∑n
i=1 1{y(i) = 0}di
φy =
∑n
i=1 1{y(i) = 1}
n .
If we were to apply Laplace smoothing (which is needed in practice for good
performance) when estimating φk|y=0 and φk|y=1, we add 1 to the numerators
and |V | to the denominators, and obtain:
φk|y=1 =
1 + ∑n
i=1
∑di
j=1 1{x(i)
j = k ∧ y(i) = 1}
|V | + ∑n
i=1 1{y(i) = 1}di
φk|y=0 =
1 + ∑n
i=1
∑di
j=1 1{x(i)
j = k ∧ y(i) = 0}
|V | + ∑n
i=1 1{y(i) = 0}di
.
While not necessarily the very best classiﬁcation algorithm, the Naive Bayes
classiﬁer often works surprisingly well. It is often also a very good “ﬁrst thing
to try,” given its simplicity and ease of implementation.

Kernel methods
5.1 Feature maps
Recall that in our discussion about linear regression, we considered the prob-
lem of predicting the price of a house (denoted by y) from the living area of
the house (denoted by x), and we ﬁt a linear function of x to the training
data. What if the price y can be more accurately represented as a non-linear
function of x? In this case, we need a more expressive family of models than
linear models.
We start by considering ﬁtting cubic functions y = θ3x3 + θ2x2 + θ1x + θ0.
It turns out that we can view the cubic function as a linear function over
the a diﬀerent set of feature variables (deﬁned below). Concretely, let the
function φ : R → R4 be deﬁned as
φ(x) =


1
x
x2
x3

 ∈ R4. (5.1)
Let θ ∈ R4 be the vector containing θ0, θ1, θ2, θ3 as entries. Then we can
rewrite the cubic function in x as:
θ3x3 + θ2x2 + θ1x + θ0 = θT φ(x)
Thus, a cubic function of the variable x can be viewed as a linear function
over the variables φ(x). To distinguish between these two sets of variables,
in the context of kernel methods, we will call the “original” input value the
input attributes of a problem (in this case, x, the living area). When the
48

49
original input is mapped to some new set of quantities φ(x), we will call those
new quantities the features variables. (Unfortunately, diﬀerent authors use
diﬀerent terms to describe these two things in diﬀerent contexts.) We will
call φ a feature map, which maps the attributes to the features.
5.2 LMS (least mean squares) with features
We will derive the gradient descent algorithm for ﬁtting the model θT φ(x).
First recall that for ordinary least square problem where we were to ﬁt θT x,
the batch gradient descent update is (see the ﬁrst lecture note for its deriva-
tion):
θ := θ + α
n∑
i=1
(
y(i) − hθ(x(i))
)
x(i)
:= θ + α
n∑
i=1
(
y(i) − θT x(i))
x(i). (5.2)
Let φ : Rd → Rp be a feature map that maps attribute x (in Rd) to the
features φ(x) in Rp. (In the motivating example in the previous subsection,
we have d = 1 and p = 4.) Now our goal is to ﬁt the function θT φ(x), with
θ being a vector in Rp instead of Rd. We can replace all the occurrences of
x(i) in the algorithm above by φ(x(i)) to obtain the new update:
θ := θ + α
n∑
i=1
(
y(i) − θT φ(x(i))
)
φ(x(i)) (5.3)
Similarly, the corresponding stochastic gradient descent update rule is
θ := θ + α
(
y(i) − θT φ(x(i))
)
φ(x(i)) (5.4)
5.3 LMS with the kernel trick
The gradient descent update, or stochastic gradient update above becomes
computationally expensive when the features φ(x) is high-dimensional. For
example, consider the direct extension of the feature map in equation (5.1)
to high-dimensional input x: suppose x ∈ Rd, and let φ(x) be the vector that

50
contains all the monomials of x with degree ≤ 3
φ(x) =

. (5.5)
The dimension of the features φ(x) is on the order of d3.1 This is a pro-
hibitively long vector for computational purpose — when d = 1000, each
update requires at least computing and storing a 1000 3 = 10 9 dimensional
vector, which is 10 6 times slower than the update rule for for ordinary least
squares updates (5.2).
It may appear at ﬁrst that such d3 runtime per update and memory usage
are inevitable, because the vector θ itself is of dimension p ≈ d3, and we may
need to update every entry of θ and store it. However, we will introduce the
kernel trick with which we will not need to store θ explicitly, and the runtime
can be signiﬁcantly improved.
For simplicity, we assume the initialize the value θ = 0, and we focus
on the iterative update (5.3). The main observation is that at any time, θ
can be represented as a linear combination of the vectors φ(x(1)), . . . , φ(x(n)).
Indeed, we can show this inductively as follows. At initialization, θ = 0 =∑n
i=1 0 · φ(x(i)). Assume at some point, θ can be represented as
θ =
n∑
i=1
βiφ(x(i)) (5.6)
1Here, for simplicity, we include all the monomials with repetitions (so that, e.g.,x1x2x3
and x2x3x1 both appear in φ(x)). Therefore, there are totally 1 + d +d2 +d3 entries in
φ(x).

51
for some β1, . . . , βn ∈ R. Then we claim that in the next round, θ is still a
linear combination of φ(x(1)), . . . , φ(x(n)) because
θ := θ + α

y(i) − θT φ(x(i))

You may realize that our general strategy is to implicitly represent the p-
dimensional vector θ by a set of coeﬃcients β1, . . . , βn. Towards doing this,
we derive the update rule of the coeﬃcients β1, . . . , βn. Using the equation
above, we see that the new βi depends on the old one via
βi := βi + α
(
y(i) − θT φ(x(i))
)
(5.8)
Here we still have the old θ on the RHS of the equation. Replacing θ by
θ = ∑n
j=1 βjφ(x(j)) gives

We often rewrite φ(x(j))

φ(x(i)) as ⟨φ(x(j)), φ(x(i))⟩ to emphasize that it’s the
inner product of the two feature vectors. Viewing βi’s as the new representa-
tion of θ, we have successfully translated the batch gradient descent algorithm
into an algorithm that updates the value of β iteratively. It may appear that
at every iteration, we still need to compute the values of ⟨φ(x(j)), φ(x(i))⟩ for
all pairs of i, j, each of which may take roughly O(p) operation. However,
two important properties come to rescue:
1. We can pre-compute the pairwise inner products ⟨φ(x(j)), φ(x(i))⟩ for all
pairs of i, j before the loop starts.
2. For the feature map φ deﬁned in (5.5) (or many other interesting fea-
ture maps), computing ⟨φ(x(j)), φ(x(i))⟩ can be eﬃcient and does not

52
necessarily require computing φ(x(i)) explicitly. This is because:
⟨φ(x), φ(z)⟩ = 1 +

= 1 + ⟨x, z⟩ + ⟨x, z⟩2 + ⟨x, z⟩3 (5.9)
Therefore, to compute ⟨φ(x), φ(z)⟩, we can ﬁrst compute ⟨x, z⟩ with
O(d) time and then take another constant number of operations to com-
pute 1 + ⟨x, z⟩ + ⟨x, z⟩2 + ⟨x, z⟩3.
As you will see, the inner products between the features ⟨φ(x), φ(z)⟩ are
essential here. We deﬁne the Kernel corresponding to the feature map φ as
a function that maps X × X → R satisfying: 2
K(x, z) ≜ ⟨φ(x), φ(z)⟩ (5.10)
To wrap up the discussion, we write the down the ﬁnal algorithm as
follows:
1. Compute all the values K(x(i), x(j)) ≜ ⟨φ(x(i)), φ(x(j))⟩ using equa-
tion (5.9) for all i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n}. Set β := 0.
2. Loop:
∀i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, βi := βi + α
(
y(i) −
n∑
j=1
βjK(x(i), x(j))
)
(5.11)
Or in vector notation, letting K be the n × n matrix with Kij =
K(x(i), x(j)), we have
β := β + α(⃗ y− Kβ)
With the algorithm above, we can update the representation β of the
vector θ eﬃciently with O(n) time per update. Finally, we need to show that
2Recall that X is the space of the input x. In our running example, X = Rd

53
the knowledge of the representation β suﬃces to compute the prediction
θT φ(x). Indeed, we have
θT φ(x) =
n∑
i=1
βiφ(x(i))
T
φ(x) =
n∑
i=1
βiK(x(i), x) (5.12)
You may realize that fundamentally all we need to know about the feature
map φ(·) is encapsulated in the corresponding kernel function K(·, ·). We
will expand on this in the next section.
5.4 Properties of kernels
In the last subsection, we started with an explicitly deﬁned feature map φ,
which induces the kernel function K(x, z) ≜ ⟨φ(x), φ(z)⟩. Then we saw that
the kernel function is so intrinsic so that as long as the kernel function is
deﬁned, the whole training algorithm can be written entirely in the language
of the kernel without referring to the feature map φ, so can the prediction of
a test example x (equation (5.12).)
Therefore, it would be tempted to deﬁne other kernel function K(·, ·) and
run the algorithm (5.11). Note that the algorithm (5.11) does not need to
explicitly access the feature map φ, and therefore we only need to ensure the
existence of the feature map φ, but do not necessarily need to be able to
explicitly write φ down.
What kinds of functions K(·, ·) can correspond to some feature map φ? In
other words, can we tell if there is some feature mapping φ so that K(x, z) =
φ(x)T φ(z) for all x, z?
If we can answer this question by giving a precise characterization of valid
kernel functions, then we can completely change the interface of selecting
feature maps φ to the interface of selecting kernel function K. Concretely,
we can pick a function K, verify that it satisﬁes the characterization (so
that there exists a feature map φ that K corresponds to), and then we can
run update rule (5.11). The beneﬁt here is that we don’t have to be able
to compute φ or write it down analytically, and we only need to know its
existence. We will answer this question at the end of this subsection after
we go through several concrete examples of kernels.
Suppose x, z ∈ Rd, and let’s ﬁrst consider the function K(·, ·) deﬁned as:
K(x, z) = (xT z)2.

54
We can also write this as
K(x, z) =
( d∑

j=1
xjzj
)
=
d∑
i=1

Thus, we see that K(x, z) = ⟨φ(x), φ(z)⟩ is the kernel function that corre-
sponds to the the feature mapping φ given (shown here for the case of d = 3)
by
φ(x) =

Revisiting the computational eﬃciency perspective of kernel, note that whereas
calculating the high-dimensional φ(x) requires O(d2) time, ﬁnding K(x, z)
takes only O(d) time—linear in the dimension of the input attributes.
For another related example, also consider K(·, ·) deﬁned by

(Check this yourself.) This function K is a kernel function that corresponds

55
to the feature mapping (again shown for d = 3)

,
and the parameter c controls the relative weighting between the xi (ﬁrst
order) and the xixj (second order) terms.
More broadly, the kernel K(x, z) = ( xT z + c)k corresponds to a feature
mapping to an
(d+k
k
)
feature space, corresponding of all monomials of the
form xi1xi2 . . . xik that are up to order k. However, despite working in this
O(dk)-dimensional space, computing K(x, z) still takes only O(d) time, and
hence we never need to explicitly represent feature vectors in this very high
dimensional feature space.
Kernels as similarity metrics. Now, let’s talk about a slightly diﬀerent
view of kernels. Intuitively, (and there are things wrong with this intuition,
but nevermind), if φ(x) and φ(z) are close together, then we might expect
K(x, z) = φ(x)T φ(z) to be large. Conversely, if φ(x) and φ(z) are far apart—
say nearly orthogonal to each other—then K(x, z) = φ(x)T φ(z) will be small.
So, we can think of K(x, z) as some measurement of how similar are φ(x)
and φ(z), or of how similar are x and z.
Given this intuition, suppose that for some learning problem that you’re
working on, you’ve come up with some functionK(x, z) that you think might
be a reasonable measure of how similar x and z are. For instance, perhaps
you chose
K(x, z) = exp
(
− ||x − z||2
2σ2
)
.
This is a reasonable measure of x and z’s similarity, and is close to 1 when
x and z are close, and near 0 when x and z are far apart. Does there exist

56
a feature map φ such that the kernel K deﬁned above satisﬁes K(x, z) =
φ(x)T φ(z)? In this particular example, the answer is yes. This kernel is called
the Gaussian kernel , and corresponds to an inﬁnite dimensional feature
mapping φ. We will give a precise characterization about what properties
a function K needs to satisfy so that it can be a valid kernel function that
corresponds to some feature map φ.
Necessary conditions for valid kernels. Suppose for now that K is
indeed a valid kernel corresponding to some feature mapping φ, and we will
ﬁrst see what properties it satisﬁes. Now, consider some ﬁnite set of n points
(not necessarily the training set) {x(1), . . . , x(n)}, and let a square, n-by-n
matrix K be deﬁned so that its ( i, j)-entry is given by Kij = K(x(i), x(j)).
This matrix is called the kernel matrix. Note that we’ve overloaded the
notation and used K to denote both the kernel function K(x, z) and the
kernel matrix K, due to their obvious close relationship.
Now, if K is a valid kernel, then Kij = K(x(i), x(j)) = φ(x(i))T φ(x(j)) =
φ(x(j))T φ(x(i)) = K(x(j), x(i)) = Kji, and hence K must be symmetric. More-
over, letting φk(x) denote the k-th coordinate of the vector φ(x), we ﬁnd that
for any vector z, we have
zT Kz =

The second-to-last step uses the fact that ∑
i,j aiaj = ( ∑
i ai)2 for ai =
ziφk(x(i)). Since z was arbitrary, this shows that K is positive semi-deﬁnite
(K ≥ 0).
Hence, we’ve shown that if K is a valid kernel (i.e., if it corresponds to
some feature mapping φ), then the corresponding kernel matrix K ∈ Rn×n
is symmetric positive semideﬁnite.

57
Suﬃcient conditions for valid kernels. More generally, the condition
above turns out to be not only a necessary, but also a suﬃcient, condition
for K to be a valid kernel (also called a Mercer kernel). The following result
is due to Mercer. 3
Theorem (Mercer). Let K : Rd × Rd ↦→ R be given. Then for K
to be a valid (Mercer) kernel, it is necessary and suﬃcient that for any
{x(1), . . . , x(n)}, (n < ∞), the corresponding kernel matrix is symmetric pos-
itive semi-deﬁnite.
Given a function K, apart from trying to ﬁnd a feature mapping φ that
corresponds to it, this theorem therefore gives another way of testing if it is
a valid kernel. You’ll also have a chance to play with these ideas more in
problem set 2.
In class, we also brieﬂy talked about a couple of other examples of ker-
nels. For instance, consider the digit recognition problem, in which given
an image (16x16 pixels) of a handwritten digit (0-9), we have to ﬁgure out
which digit it was. Using either a simple polynomial kernel K(x, z) = (xT z)k
or the Gaussian kernel, SVMs were able to obtain extremely good perfor-
mance on this problem. This was particularly surprising since the input
attributes x were just 256-dimensional vectors of the image pixel intensity
values, and the system had no prior knowledge about vision, or even about
which pixels are adjacent to which other ones. Another example that we
brieﬂy talked about in lecture was that if the objects x that we are trying
to classify are strings (say, x is a list of amino acids, which strung together
form a protein), then it seems hard to construct a reasonable, “small” set of
features for most learning algorithms, especially if diﬀerent strings have dif-
ferent lengths. However, consider letting φ(x) be a feature vector that counts
the number of occurrences of each length- k substring in x. If we’re consid-
ering strings of English letters, then there are 26 k such strings. Hence, φ(x)
is a 26 k dimensional vector; even for moderate values of k, this is probably
too big for us to eﬃciently work with. (e.g., 26 4 ≈ 460000.) However, using
(dynamic programming-ish) string matching algorithms, it is possible to ef-
ﬁciently compute K(x, z) = φ(x)T φ(z), so that we can now implicitly work
in this 26 k-dimensional feature space, but without ever explicitly computing
feature vectors in this space.
3Many texts present Mercer’s theorem in a slightly more complicated form involving
L2 functions, but when the input attributes take values in Rd, the version given here is
equivalent.
